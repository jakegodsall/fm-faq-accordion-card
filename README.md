## Notes

This project was originally completed on 24th August 2022.

This repository is part of a series of repositories that have recently been cleaned and updated as part of an overhaul of my GitHub profile. The purpose of this overhaul was to ensure that each repository reflects my current development standards and practices, and to provide a cleaner, more professional appearance.

The project is updated as of 2nd January 2024.

The implemented changes are as follows:

- Converted the project into a `Node.js` project, using a development server and compiling SASS down to CSS via `npm run` commands.
- Converted `px` units to `rem` with a root font size of `10px`.
- Converted to a mobile-first layout.
- Added transitions for opening and closing FAQ items, along with caret button rotation.
